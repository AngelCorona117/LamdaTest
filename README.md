<h3>SQLtable:</h3>
<p>This is a simple relational database designed to store user information. It is important to note that all passwords stored in this database have undergone a security process consisting of hashing, salting, and peppering, all of which are performed using the "werkzeug.security" Python library. These measures have been taken to ensure the security for the user's sensitive information.</p>

<h3>Analysis of Lambdatest Performance over Time:</h3>
<p> I have been collected several data samples of Lambdatest's website performance over time. The first sample was taken on Saturday, March 25, 2023, at 16:22, and the latest sample was taken on Saturday, April 8, 2023, at 04:41:00.</p>
<h3>Performance Before:</h3>

<h3>Performance After:</h3>

<p>The log counts also decreased from 200k+ to 112k+, despite running the same amount of tests, indicating a significant improvement in the overall website performance. Additionally, the space taken by the data has also reduced significantly, from 300000kbs in the first sample to 188000kbs in the latest sample.</p>
